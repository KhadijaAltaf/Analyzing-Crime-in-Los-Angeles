## Overview  
This project explores the **Los Angeles Crime Dataset** to uncover patterns in crime occurrences by **time of day, location, and victim demographics**.  
The analysis demonstrates skills in **exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization** to derive actionable insights.  

---

## Dataset  
- **Source**: Los Angeles Open Data Portal(here subset used)
- **Columns Used**:  
  - `DATE OCC` - Date of crime occurrence  
  - `TIME OCC` - Time of crime occurrence  
  - `AREA NAME` - Police reporting area  
  - `Crm Cd Desc` - Crime type/description  
  - `Vict Age`, `Vict Sex` - Victim demographics  
  - `LOCATION` - Crime location  

---

## Tools & Libraries  
- **Python** - Data analysis  
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** - Visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** - Interactive exploration

## Exploratory Analysis & Insights  

### Crimes by Hour of the Day  
- Crimes are **lowest between 3-6 AM**.  
- Peak activity occurs during the **afternoon and evening (12-6 PM)**.  

### Night-time Crime Hotspots  
- **Night defined**: 10 PM - 5 AM.  
- The **Central** area records the **highest number of night crimes**.  

### Victim Age Distribution  
- The most common victims are aged **25-34**, followed by **35-44**.  
- Minors (`0-17`) and elderly (`65+`) make up smaller proportions of victims.

## Key Findings  
1. **Time**: Crimes peak in the afternoon and evening.  
2. **Location**: Central LA is the largest hotspot for **night-time crimes**.  
3. **Demographics**: Young adults (25-44) are most at risk.  

---

## Next Steps  
- Explore **yearly trends** in crime to see long-term patterns.  
- Compare **crime types** (e.g., theft, assault) by time and area.  
- Add **geospatial mapping** to visualize hotspots across LA.  
- Experiment with **predictive modeling** to forecast crime risks.

## Conclusion  
This project demonstrates how real-world crime data can be explored to uncover patterns across **time, location, and demographics**.  
The findings highlight key insights into **when and where crimes occur most often**, as well as **who is most affected**, providing a foundation for smarter public safety strategies.
